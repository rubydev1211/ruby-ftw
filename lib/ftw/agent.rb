# * WebSockets (RFC6455).
# * Support Cookies.
#
# All standard HTTP methods defined by RFC2616 are available as methods on 
# this agent: get, head, put, etc.

# Example:

#     agent = FTW::Agent.new

#     response = agent.execute(request)
#     puts response.body.read

# and it will execute and return a FTW::Response object:
#
#     agent = FTW::Agent.new
#     response = agent.get!("http://www.google.com/")
#     puts response.body.head
#
# TODO(sissel): TBD: implement cookies... delicious chocolate chip cookies.
