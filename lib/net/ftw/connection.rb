# TODO(sissel): What's the API look like here?
# EventMachine::Connection has these:
#   * events: post_init (and connection_completed), receive_data, unbind
#   * methods: send_data, close
# Socket has
#   * no events
#   * methods: connect, read, write, close
#
# Actual events:
#   * connected
#   * disconnected(reason)
#     * timeout, connection reset, connection refused, write error, read
#        error, etc
#   * data received
#
# Methods
#   * send data
#   * reconnect
#   * get socket
#   * disconnect
#

# A network connection. This is TCP.
#
# Example:
#
#     conn = Net::FTW::Connection.new("www.google.com:80")

#       puts "Connected to #{address} (#{conn.peer})"

#     conn.on(DATA) do |data|
#       puts data
