# THIS FILE HAS BEEN ABANDONED. PLEASE READ:
# FTW cannot run on Rack due to technical limitations in the Rack design,
# specifically:
#
# * rack.input must be buffered, to support IO#rewind, for the duration of each
#   request. This is not safe if that request is an HTTP Upgrade or a long
#   upload.
#
# As a result, this rack handler implementation has been abandoned.
# 
# The above decision is based on the response to this ticket:
#   https://github.com/rack/rack/issues/347
